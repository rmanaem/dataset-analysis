# Veracity Detection Using Supervised Learning

## Abstract

Dawn of the digital age and the World Wide Web paved the way for dissemination of high volumes of unrefined information through online media outlets and social media platforms. Ease of access, corporate and political biases, and lack of appropriate moderation in these platforms has resulted in propagation of false information and fabricated news, forging an essential demand for filtration. This project aims at analyzing related data using supervised learning techniques and algorithms to develop models for veracity detection. Our work will explore different textual properties and patterns that can be extracted and used to train models to classify news articles as disinformation or authentic.

## Introduction

The rise of the internet and more specifically digital media outlets like Facebook and Twitter have allowed any individual to share anything that is on their mind. The sharing of information comes with major challenges with such as the veracity of the information shared. This is particularly important, as these digital pieces of information have the potential to influence major events like the US Presidential Elections. In fact, in a study done by Buzzfeed, fake news stories have received more engagement on Facebook then real news [2].
