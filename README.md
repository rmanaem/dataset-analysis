# Veracity Detection Using Supervised Learning

## Abstract

Dawn of the digital age and the World Wide Web paved the way for dissemination of high volumes of unrefined information through online media outlets and social media platforms. Ease of access, corporate and political biases, and lack of appropriate moderation in these mediums has resulted in propagation of false information and fabricated news, forging an essential demand for filtration. This project aims at analyzing related data using supervised learning tools and techniques to develop models for veracity detection. This work explores different textual properties and patterns that appear in news articles to extract linguistic features for training models using classification algorithms.

## Introduction

The advent of technology has surged through all aspect of life revolutionizing the way we receive, process, and pass on information. Multitude of our decisions are based on the information reported and broadcasted through different news and media outlets. These outlets and other entities utilize social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, …) to further disseminate information to a broader audience. In a world where news organizations and the press have their own specific corporate and political allegiances and our means of communication and sharing information are designed to reinforce pre-existing biases, its essential to recognize the significance of validity of the available information. The 2016 US presidential election is widely used as the prime example to demonstrate the impact of disinformation on major events. Propagation of fake news through Facebook and Twitter in the months leading up to the election influenced voter turnout in democratic voters and voter decision in apolitical voters altering the course of the election [1].

The task of validating news as essential as it may be, can be time consuming and difficult even for experts as It requires exhaustive research into different aspects. To tackle these challenges, automatic detection models have been researched by employing artificial intelligence and machine learning principles. One of the recent works proposed a novel hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks for fabricated news classification. This model was able to successfully validate two fake news datasets and achieve results that were significantly better than other non-hybrid baseline methods [2]. Another study utilized machine learning ensemble approach to train a combination of different machine learning algorithms to expand their research beyond the domain of the existing literature. The ensemble learners showed promising results in a wide variety of applications as the learning models had the tendency to reduce error rate using techniques such as bagging and boosting [3].

This project is aimed at automating classification of news articles by training and testing machine learning models using supervised learning tools and techniques. This work explores key words, phrases, and other textual properties that appear in news articles to extract linguistic features for training models using classification algorithms.
