# Veracity Detection Using Supervised Learning

## Abstract

Technological advances have led to high volumes of easily accessible and unrefined data from a variety of sources resulting in propagation of false information, fake news and creating an essential demand for data filtration. This project aims at analyzing data using supervised learning technologies and algorithms to develop a model for veracity detection. For analysis a public dataset of size 110 MB, containing a list of articles from 2016 to 2017, has been selected [1]. This data set contains the title, content, category, and the date of the articles as attributes of its entries. Findings and details of the project are delivered through the project report. The project report will start by introducing the context, objectives, presentation of the problem, and related work. It will then review the materials and methods used for analysis and go on to showcase the results of the study. lastly, there will be a discussion of the relevance of the solution, of limitations, and of possible future work.

## Introduction

The rise of the internet and more specifically digital media outlets like Facebook and Twitter have allowed any individual to share anything that is on their mind. The sharing of information comes with major challenges with such as the veracity of the information shared. This is particularly important, as these digital pieces of information have the potential to influence major events like the US Presidential Elections. In fact, in a study done by Buzzfeed, fake news stories have received more engagement on Facebook then real news [2].
